ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TatianaT13!

ğŸ‘€ Passionate about AI development and data analytics, I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree to become a project manager in artificial intelligence with Datascientest.com.

ğŸŒ± As an apprentice at APRR, I work on Business Intelligence projects using Snowflake and Power BI, which helps me gain clearer insights into the areas I might explore within AI.

ğŸ’¡ Iâ€™m looking for collaboration opportunities on GitHub to exchange ideas and innovate in AI and BI.
